                                    <li>Hold L + Start while loading your game to return to the sanctum of the last visited town or city, a.k.a. sanctum warping. This can be used in case you are stuck.</li>
                                    <li>Retreat can be used in all areas, including towns. This can cause you to become stuck in some situations. Sanctum warping will be your way out.</li>

                                    <li>Retreat can be used on the world map, where it will act like Teleport. This allows it to be used with less than 6 PP, despite what the Psynergy menu might say.</li>
                                    <li>When using Teleport, selecting your current location or your boat will instead take you to the beach west of Madra.</li>

                                    <li>Avoid will prevent encounters regardless of level, and remains active until used again.</li>
                                    <li>Utility Psynergy will go to the leftmost party member. Once a character has learned 15 utility Psynergy, they will be skipped over and the Psynergy goes to the next party member.</li>
                                    <li>Characters are limited to having 9 Djinn each. If there is no more space in the current party, Djinn will be sent to a party member that hasn't joined yet.</li>

                                    <li>When in doubt, don't hesitate to check the spoiler log. Please report unsolvable seeds so they can be fixed quickly.</li>
